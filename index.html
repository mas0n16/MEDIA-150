        I am a Media student at Hunter College. I have a passion for creating content with effective visual communication. Through my studies, I will explore the intersection of media, culture, 
        and society, as well as how they influence each other. My goal is to create impactful content that widens eyes and sparks meaningful conversations. I am mostly interested in the entertainment 
        industry, specifically creative expression and business in the music industry. I am also passionate about advocacy for human rights and politics. Finding the intersections between my interests
        and my studies is something I look forward to discovering and creating with during my time at Hunter College. I am looking forward to making content that invokes emotions and inspires change. 
        I believe media can be a powerful tool for social change, and I am excited to be a part of that process! I have experience in experiential marketing, content creation, and creating memorable experiences
        for audiences. I am thoroughly excited to learn new skills and techniques that will help me grow as a professional in media.
