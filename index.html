    <p><b>Creative Statement</b></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 15px;width:800px;">
        I am a Media student at Hunter College. I have a passion for creating and visual communication. Through my studies, I aim to explore the intersection of media, culture, 
        and society, and how they influence each other. My goal is to create impactful content that widens eyes and sparks meaningful conversations. I am mostly interested in the entertainment 
        industry, specifically business and production in the music industry. I am also passionate about advocacy for human rights and politics. Finding the intersections between my interests
        and my studies is something I look forward to exploring during my time at Hunter College. I am looking forward to creating content that invokes emotions and inspires change. 
        I believe media can be a powerful tool for social change, and I am excited to be a part of that process.
