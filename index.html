    <p><b>Creative Statement</b>
        <br>
        <br>I am a Media Studies major at Hunter College. I have a passion for creating and visual communication. Through my studies, I aim to explore the intersection of media, culture, 
        <br> and society, and how they influence each other. My goal is to create impactful content that widens eyes and sparks meaningful conversations. I am mostly interested in the entertainment 
        <br> industry, specifically business and production in the music industry. I am also passionate about advocacy for human rights and politics. Finding the intersections between my interests
        <br> and my studies is something I look forward to exploring during my time at Hunter College.
